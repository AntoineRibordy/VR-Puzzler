# What is it?
These scripts were used to build a mobile VR game called VR Puzzler. They are intended for use with Google Cardboard. I'm using them in conjunction with Unity 3D.

VR Puzzler is a Simon-says type of game, where the player enters a dungeon and then has to solve a riddle to escape that dungeon.

I built that game as part of the [VR developer nanodegree] (https://www.udacity.com/course/vr-developer-nanodegree--nd017) on Udacity.

# How to Use
Add a script you want to use as a component on a Unity GameObject. Drag and drop any required missing element for the script in the Inspector in Unity.

Read the comments in the code to understand what the script does. In most cases, the name of the script will give you a good hint at what it does.

# Supported SW / Compatibility
The scripts work with Unity 5.4. This is what I'm using to build the game.

If you want to use them for earlier version of Unity (in particular with Unity 4), you'll have to change the syntax of some commands.
